# vimomap
When your (pair-) programming on an alien machine and keep hitting Caps-key for escape, like on your home machine, this script will save the day! Run it once to SSS (set sane settings) and once more to SIS (set insane settings). I'm not sure but I believe the name is derived from vi(m) (x)modmap.
